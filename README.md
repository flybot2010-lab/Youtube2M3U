# Youtube2M3U
A slow and cobbled together mess for converting YOUTUBE PLAYLISTS into PLAYABLE M3U FILES.

(Pull Request Improvements Greatly Appreciated)

This is NOT compatabile with LIVE STREAMS. This is for PLAYLISTS.

Just edit the py file with your designated playlist, and let it role.

It takes about 46 seconds for the default playlist on my hardware.

## Prerequisites.
Python 3 (Duh) (Newest Avalible Version If Possible)

Internet (perferably with a vpn)

yt-dlp (pip install yt_dlp)

m3u8 (pip install m3u8)
## System Requirements
Recommended System
16+ GB of ram. (all the video info is stored in ram before being wrote to the m3u8)
VPN. (Don't get ratelimited!)
Ethernet. (Speeder Downloads Of Video Info)
## Why?
