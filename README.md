# Youtube2M3U
A slow and cobbled together mess for converting YOUTUBE PLAYLISTS into PLAYABLE M3U FILES.

(Pull Request Improvements Greatly Appreciated)

This is NOT compatabile with LIVE STREAMS. This is for PLAYLISTS.

It takes about 46 seconds for the default playlist on my hardware.

(Be warned, the bigger the playlist, the longer and more ram you will need.)

Please make sure the playlist is Public or Unlisted. Private Playlist Don't Work.

The NON-GUI version is not actively maintained and is not recommended for use.

## Prerequisites.
Python 3 (Duh) (Newest Avalible Version If Possible)

Internet (perferably with a vpn)

yt-dlp (pip install yt_dlp)

m3u8 (pip install m3u8)

Tkinter (pip install tk)

## System Requirements

LOTS OF RAM. (all the video info is stored in ram before being wrote to the m3u8)

VPN. (Don't get ratelimited!)

Ethernet. (Optional) (Speedier Downloads Of Video Info)

## Why?
